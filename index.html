        <p class="intro">Hello. Welcome to DJ's Autism Self-Support. Autism is a complex thing. The differences in things like emotional processing and sensory intensity vary between each person with autism.This site was designed with sensory considerations first. This site aims to be a landing page for people with low needs or level 1 autism. Low needs does not mean that minimal support is needed. Here you'll find resources to read through about the different challenges and behaviors that level 1 individuals face and be provided with resources for more information and support for these challenges. The information here comes from official sources which you will be provided links to for full text versions of the full documents and references to learn even more about autism than you'll find here. This site is meant to be a first step and a primer for your journey through the world. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro">My hope is that you learn more about yourself, and learn techniques to deal with the unique journies that we all face. That being said, I am not a professional. I am simply someone that empathizes with the social challenges of autism. I've spent a lot of time communicating with people who have autism. My godson is non-verbal, and my niece is too. I've found much joy participating in giving them an outlet to communicate with their world. Please use the resources here to find better ways to support yourself. As someone who deals with sensory issues I have provided a few examples of media that can be calming, but remember that we're all different and what may be calming to some could very well be overstimulating to others. In the future any personal anecdotal data will be clearly labeled as such. If you see [Personal anecdotal] in a heading remember that this is my own subjective experience, and you should consult a professional first before attempting what has worked for me. The goal of these sections is to give you hope and reassurance that there are ways to work through your journey.</p>
